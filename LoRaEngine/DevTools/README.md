# DevTools #

This directory contains small console applications used for manual testing during development.

Includes
* **PacketForwarderSimulator** - executable
* **LoRaWanNetworkSrvCmdWrapper** - Sergiy's executable used during development process
* **DevTool1** - executable used during development process
* **DevTool2** - executable used during development process
* etc . . .

**NOTE:** Until we have a unit test framework in place, we are relying on small executables, maintained by each developer, for the purposes of testing and demonstrating module functionality. Each of these executables should have a README.md file that demonstrates how to run the code.
